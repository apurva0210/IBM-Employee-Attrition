# IBM-Employee-Attrition-EDA

*Introduction*:

IBM is a leading company with a substantial workforce. To address concerns related to employee attrition, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is required. The dataset contains various attributes such as age, job satisfaction, tenure, and more.

*Objective*:

The objective is to conduct a comprehensive EDA to gain insights into the factors influencing employee attrition at IBM. This analysis will help in understanding the key drivers and potentially lead to strategies for retention.

*Challenges*:

1. **Understanding Attrition Patterns**:
   - Identifying the underlying patterns and trends in employee attrition within the organization.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Determining which demographic and job-related attributes are strongly correlated with attrition.

3. **Impact of Job Satisfaction**:
   - Assessing how job satisfaction levels relate to employee attrition rates.

4. **Analyzing Career Growth**:
   - Investigating if career growth factors, like promotions and role changes, impact attrition.

5. **Managerial Influence**:
   - Evaluating if manager tenure or performance affects employee attrition.

*Requirements*:

The analysis should include:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Utilizing statistical and visualization techniques to uncover insights.

3. **Correlation Assessment**:
   - Identifying key factors correlated with attrition.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Providing visual representations of the data for better understanding.

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Offering insights and potential strategies for attrition reduction.

*Deliverables*:

IBM expects the following:

1. **Comprehensive EDA Report**:
   - Summarizing findings, including visualizations and key takeaways.

2. **Key Insights Presentation**:
   - A presentation highlighting crucial insights and recommendations.

By conducting this EDA, IBM aims to gain a deeper understanding of employee attrition patterns and implement strategies to improve retention and organizational stability.
